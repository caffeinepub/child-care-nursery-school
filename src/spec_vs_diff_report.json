  "summary": "Diff adds a production-safe asset URL helper, updates frontend components to use it for static assets, and introduces a deployment guide and a Node-based smoke-test script. However, it does not provide evidence of an actual Internet Computer mainnet deployment having been performed, nor does it include the required live URL(s) and canister ID(s).",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Deploy the current application version to the Internet Computer mainnet so the site is publicly accessible, and provide the resulting live URL(s) and canister ID(s). After deployment, smoke-test production routes (/ , /learn-more, /special-event) and confirm static assets (including /assets/generated/school-logo.dim_512x512.png) load correctly.",
      "reason": "The diff only adds documentation/scripts and frontend code adjustments; it does not include evidence of a completed mainnet deployment or the resulting live URL(s) and canister ID(s) as required by REQ-19.",
